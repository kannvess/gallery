# Gallery
A "Gallery"-like "monolith" comprising of the backend, web, mobile, and desktop app using Bun + Elysia + PostgreSQL + React + React Native + Tauri.

# TODO
- Create a web app serving placeholder content as proof-of-concept
- Create a backend to serve content uploaded by the client
- Integrate Tauri to build a desktop app
- Initialize a React Native mobile app

# Purpose
This project is used for my own learning purposes about code reducibility/reusability. I may not accept contributors but welcome constructive criticism and discussions regarding this topic.

# Future ideas
- Migrate the web app to Solid + Astro (to identify issues regarding migrations and code reusability)
